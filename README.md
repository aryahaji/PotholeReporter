# PotholeReporter

Potholes are a big problem in Buffalo, NY. You can ask anybody here and they will talk about how much they hate them. Personally last year I went through 5 tires in a short 3-4 month span because of how bad the potholes were. Our idea was to create a web app that users can go to report potholes to their specific town in WNY. We would implement a ticketing system where the user can upload an image of the pothole as well as the location and the severity of it so that when town officials look at the web site they can see which potholes are a priority to fix. We would also implement an interactive map where the users can see where the potholes are on the map.
